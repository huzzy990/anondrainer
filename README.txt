## Notes !!!IMPORTANT!!!

In light of the numerous inquiries we have received from less experienced individuals regarding the demand for a guided configuration
we wish to emphasize that the BACKEND cannot be hosted on the Cyclic platform.
This decision is primarily attributed to the fact that the specific libraries and features requested are not supported within the framework of our project.
We value the integrity and efficiency of our system and, as such, we must adhere to the limitations and standards we have established for its development.
We appreciate your understanding and encourage you to explore alternative hosting options that align with your specific requirements.
